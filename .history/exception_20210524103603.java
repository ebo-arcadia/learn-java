// event interrupts program flow
// object wraps error even info 
// error occurs in method
// error is sent to run time system
// used to indicate types of errors

// compile time errors => syntax errors & semantic errors (declare var twice)
// runtime errors => server is down during production run time but code is fine

// why exception?
// how to handle exception?
